          question:
            "Q1. If the sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon measures up to 1440°, then how many sides does the polygon have?",
          options: ["8 sides", "9 sides", "10 sides", "12 sides"],
          correct: "10 sides",
          explanation:
            "The sum of interior angles is given by the formula (n-2) × 180°, where n is the number of sides. Solving for n: (n-2) × 180 = 1440, so n = 10.",
        },
        {
          question:
            "Q2. What is the quadrilateral formed by the angle bisectors of a parallelogram?",
          options: ["Square", "Rectangle", "Circle", "Rhombus"],
          correct: "Rectangle",
          explanation:
            "The angle bisectors of a parallelogram always form a rectangle, regardless of the parallelogram's dimensions.",
        },
        {
          question:
            "Q3. Which of the quadrilaterals has all angles as right angles, opposite sides equal, and diagonals bisect each other?",
          options: ["Rectangle", "Rhombus", "Square", "None of these"],
          correct: "Rectangle",
          explanation:
            "A rectangle has all right angles, equal opposite sides, and diagonals that bisect each other.",
        },
        {
          question:
            "Q4. Diagonals of which of the following quadrilaterals do not bisect it into two congruent triangles?",
          options: ["Rhombus", "Trapezium", "Square", "Rectangle"],
          correct: "Trapezium",
          explanation:
            "Diagonals of a trapezium do not divide it into congruent triangles unless it is isosceles.",
        },
        {
          question: "Q5. Which of the following are true about a rhombus?",
          options: [
            "The sides are all congruent.",
            "The diagonals are congruent.",
            "It has four right angles.",
            "All of the above.",
          ],
          correct: "The sides are all congruent.",
          explanation:
            "A rhombus has all sides equal, but its diagonals are not always congruent, and it does not necessarily have right angles.",

          question: "Q6. Which of the following are true about a square?",
          options: [
            "The diagonals are congruent.",
            "The sides are congruent.",
            "The diagonals are perpendicular.",
            "All of the above.",
          ],
          correct: "All of the above.",
          explanation:
            "A square has congruent sides and diagonals, and its diagonals are perpendicular to each other.",

          question:
            "Q7. Two numbers are in the ratio 7:9. If the sum of the numbers is 112, then the larger number is:",
          options: ["49", "72", "63", "42"],
          correct: "63",
          explanation:
            "If the ratio is 7:9, the total parts are 16. The larger number is (9/16) × 112 = 63.",
        },
        {
          question:
            "Q8. Rakesh has Rs. 10 and Karan has 10 paise. Find the ratio of money with Rakesh and money with Karan.",
          options: ["1/100", "100/1", "10/500", "5/2"],
          correct: "100/1",
          explanation:
            "Rs. 10 = 1000 paise, so the ratio of money is 1000:10 = 100:1.",

          question: "Q9. The average of the first 5 multiples of 9 is:",
          options: ["20", "27", "28", "30"],
          correct: "27",
          explanation:
            "The first 5 multiples of 9 are 9, 18, 27, 36, and 45. Their sum is 135, so the average is 135 ÷ 5 = 27.",

          correct: "55",
          explanation:
            "The average is the sum of the numbers divided by the count. 550 ÷ 10 = 55.",
