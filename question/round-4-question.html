  {
    question: "Q1. A man walked diagonally across a square lot. Approximately, what was the percent saved by not walking along the edges?",
    options: [
      "20%",
      "24%",
      "29%",
      "33%",
    ],
   
    correct: "33%",
    explanation: "Walking along the edges would involve two sides of the square, but walking diagonally saves approximately 33% of the distance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q2. The ratio between the perimeter and the breadth of a rectangle is 5:1. If the area of the rectangle is 216 sq. cm, what is the length of the rectangle?",
    options: [
      "16 cm",
      "18 cm",
      "24 cm",
      "Data inadequate",
    ],
    correct: "18 cm",
    explanation: "Using the formula for perimeter and area, solve for the length as 18 cm.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q3. An article is at 10% more than the CP. If a discount of 10% is allowed, then which of the following is correct?",
    options: [
      "1% gain",
      "1% loss",
      "No gain no loss",
      "1.1% loss",
    ],
    correct: "1% loss",
    explanation: "If an article is priced 10% above cost and a 10% discount is given, there will be a 1% loss.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q4. What time period is taken when interest is calculated half yearly?",
    options: [
      "Twice as much as the number of given years",
      "Half as much as the number of given years",
      "Same as the number of given years",
      "None of these",
    ],
    correct: "Half as much as the number of given years",
    explanation: "For half-yearly calculations, the time period is halved compared to yearly calculations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q5. At what rate per annum will Rs. 400/- amount to Rs. 585/- in 3 years?",
    options: [
      "10%",
      "8%",
      "12%",
      "9%",
    ],
    correct: "12%",
    explanation: "Using the simple interest formula, the rate is calculated as 12%.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q6. From the given diagram, if ∠SOQ = 72° and ROQ = 2:3, then what are the values of angles ∠SOQ and ∠ROQ?",
    image: "/image/6.png", // Add an image file for this question.
    options: [
      "54° and 36°",
      "40° and 60°",
      "72° and 108°",
      "None of these",
    ],
    correct: "72° and 108°",
    explanation: "The ratios 2:3 are proportional, leading to angle calculations of 72° and 108°.",
    image: "/image/6.png", // Add an image file for this question.
  },
  {
    question: "Q7. Find the value of ∠ABC if PQ || RS.",
    image: "/image/7.png", // Add an image file for this construction question.
    options: [
      "70°",
      "140°",
      "110°",
      "90°",
    ],
    correct: "110°",
    explanation: "Using the properties of parallel lines and angles, the angle is calculated as 110°.",
   
  },
  {
    question: "Q8. A diagonal of a rectangle is inclined to one side of the rectangle at 25°. The acute angle between the diagonals is:",
    options: [
      "35°",
      "50°",
      "40°",
      "25°",
    ],
    correct: "40°",
    explanation: "The acute angle between the diagonals is derived using trigonometric relationships.",
  },
